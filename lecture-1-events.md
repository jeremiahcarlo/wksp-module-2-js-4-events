---

#### User Interface Events

- `load`
- `unload`
- `error`
- `resize`
- `scroll`

---

#### Focus and Blur Events

These events fire when the HTML elements you can interact with gain/ lose focus.

- `focus` - only happens when you click
- `blur`
- `focusin` (_new; not supported by Firefox_)
- `focusout` (_new; same as blur; not supported by Firefox_)

---

##### Mouse Events

- `click`
- `dblclick`
- `mousedown`  
- `mouseup`  
- `mouseover` - hover
- `mouseout` - hover away
- `mousemove` - anytime the mouse moves

---

##### Keyboard Events

- `input`
- `keydown` - key held down
- `keypress` -  key pressed (single)
- `keyup` - key press released 

---

### Form Events

- `submit` -  
- `change` - 
- `input` -

---

### HTML5 Events

- `DOMContentLoaded`
- `hashchange` 
- `beforeunload` - puts up an alert when the user tries to leave the page

---

### CSS Events

- `transitionend` - 
- `animationstart`
- `animationend`

---

### Events and DOM Nodes

All DOM nodes have methods we can use to _notify_ us of an event.

- [`addEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener) [require 2 arguments]
- [`removeEventListener()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/removeEventListener)

```js
// Example
cont button = document.getElementById('btn');
function handleOuch = function() {
    console.log('ouch!');
}
// add it
button.addEventListener('click', handleOuch);

// remove it 
button.removeEventListener('click', handleOuch);

```

---

### [Event Object](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_event.asp)

Event handler functions are passed an argument, when events are triggered.

This object includes lots of stuff.

- `preventDefault()`
- `target`
- `stopPropagation()`

---
    
### Default Actions

Some events have _default_ actions associated to them.

- click a link
- press down arrow
- click `submit` in a Form

In most cases handlers are called _before_ the default action takes place.

You can prevent the _default_ action from happening by calling `event.preventDefault();` in the eventListener function.

---
    
### target

- The  `target` property refers to the node where they originated. (example)
- With an `input`, use `event.target.value` to read what was entered into an `input`.

---

### Propagation

Handlers registered on nodes with children will also receive events that happen in the children.

```html
<div>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#"><img scr="..."></a></li>
        ...
    </ul>
</div>
```

---

### 3 Phases of Event Propagation

- The Event Capture Phase
- The Event Target Phase
- The Event Bubbling Phase - 

**most** events bubble

`<p>A paragraph with a <button id="the-btn">button</button>.</p>`

```js
    
let para = document.querySelector("p");
let button = document.querySelector("button");

para.addEventListener("mousedown", () => {
    console.log("Handler for paragraph.");
});

button.addEventListener("mousedown", event => {
    console.log("Handler for button.");
    if (event.button == 2) event.stopPropagation();
});
```
---

## Events and the Event Loop

Events can only be processed when _nothing_ else is running.

This means that other page processes will be delayed until there is time to process it.

This can occur if you have long-running event handlers, or _lots_ of short-running ones.
